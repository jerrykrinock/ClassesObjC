/*!
 @brief    Useful in running exclusive processes.
 
 @details  Note that SSYSemaphores are not identified with the process
 that acquired them.  This is by design, so that it is possible
 for one process to acquire a semaphore, pass the key to another
 process, terminate, and then the other process clears the
 semaphore.  The danger of this is that SSYSemaphore therefore
 keeps no knowledge of the acquiring process, and if the
 acquiring process terminates unexpectedly, and then another
 process wants the semaphore, SSYSemaphore will *not* check
 and see if the first process is still running, judge that
 it may have crashed and give the semaphore to the other process.
 Other processes will be prevented from acquiring the semaphore.
 SSYSemaphore features a time limit (timeLimit) to mitigate this
 danger.
 
 SSYSemaphore is implemented by writing a .SSYSemaphore file to
 the application's Application Support folder.  Thinking about this,
 here on 20120302, I wonder why I didn't write (and synchronize)
 a key into BookMacster's User Defaults instead.  It doesn't
 really matter, though.  Actually, it may be fewer lines of code
 this way because writing a file is only one line of code but
 writing and synchronizing user defaults is two lines of code.
 Also, a file is more visible for debugging than a user default.
 Most of the code in this implementation is for checking timeouts.
 
 When using this class, [NSApp delegate] must conform to protocol
 SSYAppSupporter.

/*!
 @brief    Attempts to acquire exclusively the receiver's system
 semaphore, blocking and retrying up to its timeout.
 
 @details  Send this message before beginning a task which needs exclusive
 access to system resources guarded by the semaphore.
 
 Begins by setting the receiver's current backoff, a private attribute, to its
 initial backoff.  Then begins attempts...
 
 If the receiver's system semaphore cannot be obtained because it already exists
 exclusively on the system, sleeps for the receiver's current backoff,
 multiplies the backoff by the backoff factor, limits the backoff to the max
 backoff, and repeats this until either the semaphore is obtained or the
 receiver's timeout is exceeded.
 
 @param    timeout  The time interval after which lockError_p will give up and
 return NO if it cannot acquire its receiver's system semaphore.
 @param    timeLimit  The period of time which the previous
 semaphore acquisition is allowed to retain the semaphore,
 after which this method will succeed and rudely overwrite
 the semaphore.  This is intended to be a fail-safe mechanism
 in case an acquiring process terminates unexpectedly without
 either clearing the semaphore or passing the key on to another
 process which should clear the semaphore.
 @param    error_p  Upon return, if an error occurs, points to a
 relevant NSError*.  If a timeout occurred, the error
 code will be ETIME.  Pass NULL if you don't want the error.
 @result    YES if the semaphore was obtained.
 NO if the timeout was exceeded, or some other unrecoverable
 eror occurred.
