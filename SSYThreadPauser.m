     Here's a fun 64-bit quirk that set me back a couple hours.  If you ever
     write a method which creates a date from an NSTimeInterval parameter, make
     sure that you can't create an unreasonably large date.  I'd been passing
     FLT_MAX to indicate "no timeout" to such a method.
     
     Works OK in 32-bit.  In 64-bit, -[NSDate compare:] and -[NSDate laterDate:]
     still work as expected.  But other methods may not.  For example,
     -[NSConditionLock lockWhenCondition:beforeDate:] seems to think that such
     a "float max date" has already past and returns NO immediately, regardless
     of its 'condition'.
     
     The solution is the next two linesâ€¦
