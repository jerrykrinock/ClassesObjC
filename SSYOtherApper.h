/*!
 @brief    A class of class methods for observing and controlling other applications.

 @detail   A couple of notes:

 ## ProcessSerialNumber is only for Apps

 Many of the methods in this class refer to a process' ProcessSerialNumber,
 which exists and therefore the methods work only upon "applications", defined
 as "things which can appear in the Dock that are not documents and are
 launched by the Finder or Dock". (See documentation of
 ProcessSerialNumber).

 ## Definition of "Executable"

 Many of the methods in this class refer to a process' Executable.  This is the
 string returned for the "comm" keyword of /bin/ps.  The documentation
 `man ps` defines this as the "command" of the process, and implies that it
 is the path to the running executable.  However, for some XPC Services, and
 this happens for BkmxAgent which is launched by SMLoginItemSetEnabled(),
 you get instead the bundle identifier of the XPC Service.  I don't know why.
 It looks like Arq Agent is similarly a Login Item of Arq (it is located at
 Arq.app/Library/LoginItems/Arq Agent.app), but its "command" shows in -ps as:
 /Applications/Arq.app/Contents/Library/LoginItems/Arq Agent.app/Contents/MacOS/Arq Agent,
 in other words, the path to the executable.

 Note that this method considers all processes for all users: anything that shows
 by executing the unix 'ps' command.  It launches an NSTask to do this; therefore
 AppKit is not required.
 
 In testing, on an admin account, I see that it will return results for processes
 owned by other users, and for processes owned by root.  But I have not confirmed
 this theoretically.  See test code below.

 @brief    Returns the unix process ID (pid) of any process whose last path
 component matches a given process name, and whose user id is the same
 user id as the current process, or 0 if no such process is running.

 @details  Starting with BookMacster 1.9, this method is now based on
 -pidsExecutablesFull:, which is in turn based on /bin/ps, so that it gets
 all processes, regardless of background, bundle, app, or GUI.
 
 Prior to BookMacster 1.9, this method used the Carbon Process Manager and
 therefore did not find all such running processes.  For example, it would
 find QuicKeysBackgroundEngine, mdworker, SystemUIServer, SizzlingKeys4iTunes,
 loginwindow, and iTunesHelper.  But it would not find BookMacster-Quatch.
 Will not return zombie (Z) or (UEs) processes.  It also did not properly
 discriminate users.

 whose process we want the pid of.  Pass NSUserName() for the current user.
 Pass nil for any user.

/*!
 @brief    Returns an array with one element for each running executable, with each element
 being a dictionary containing entries for pid, user, and command.
 
 @details  This method uses the unix "ps" instead of [[NSWorkspace sharedWorkspace] launchedApplications]
 The "advantage" of this is that it does not use AppKit, therefore does not invoke
 WindowServer, therefore does not raise an exception if the user is not the console user.
 The disadvantage is that it uses NSTask, and did not work in finding Bookwatchdog
 for a certain user.
 @param    fullExecutablePath  YES to return the full path to each executable as
 the value of the "command" key.  NO to return only the executable name
 (last path component).  See class documentation for definition of "executable".
 @result   The array of dictionaries.  Each dictionary contains four keys:
 *  SSYOtherApperKeyPid, whose value is an NSNumber
 *  SSYOtherApperKeyUser, whose value is an NSString, the short name of the user
 *  SSYOtherApperKeyEtime, whose value is an NSString, the "elapsed running
 time" of the process; see etime in man ps(1).  Unfortunately, the format
 is not specified.  It seems to be DD-HH:MM:SS, where the DD- is: omitted for
 processes which have been running less than 24 hours, "0N-" for processes
 running 1-10 days, presumably "NN-" for process running 10-100 days, presumably
 "NNN-" for processes running 100-1000 days.

 executable name or a full path.  See class documentation for definition of
 "executable".

 process is that of another user and the current user does *not* have
 administrator priviliges.  If you are sure that the target process is

 @brief    Finds a running app, owned by the current user,
 with a given bundle path, sends it a "quit application" Apple Event message,
 and returns when the app is quit or timeout occurs, whichever comes first.
 
 @details  Will block the thread until the target app quits, or timeout.

 @param    bundle path  The bundle path of the application to be
 quit, or nil to no-op.
 @param    closeWindows  If YES, will tell the subject app to 'close windows'
 before quitting.

 Affirming closeWindows improves the probability that the quitting will work,
 and has been found to be effective with Google Chrome and Firefox in
 particular (June 2011).  It was suggested by Shane Stanleyâ€¦
 http://lists.apple.com/archives/applescript-implementors/2011/Jun/msg00010.html

 With most apps, closeWindows will stop the state restoration of macOS from
 re-opening the closed windows upon relaunch.

 With some apps, for example Roccat, closeWindows will cause open tabs,
 which should be remembered for the next launch, to be forgotten.

 @param    killAfterTimeout  This parameter was added in BookMacster 1.9.8
 after I found Google Chrome in a state where it wouldn't quit, not even if
 you activated it and clicked "Quit" in its menu.  Then, I found that this only
 happened maybe 2/100 times.  Weird.

 @param    wasRunning_p  If not nil, on return, will point to a value
 indicating whether or not the target app was indeed running and needed
 to be quit, or NO if the given bundle path was nil

 @result   YES if the target app was not running, or if it quit within
 the allowed timeout, or if bundleIdentifier was nil.  NO if app was
 still running when timeout expired.
