/*
 @param    wength  The width = length of the square image to be returned
 @param    color  The fill and stroke color of the result, and indication of
 whether or not you want a so-called "template image".  If you pass nil, the
 fill and stroke color will be black, and also the result will be a "template
 image".  Otherwise, the result will not be a "template image".  See
 -[NSImage setTemplate:] documentation for more information.
 @param    rotateDegrees  Measure by which the result will be rotated clockwise
 @param    inset  Percent of wength by which to inset the desired shape from the
 given wength on all four edges.  The maximum useful value of inset is 50.0, at
 which the returned image will be empty because if you take 50% from each edge
 you are left with zero.
 
 @details  Known Bug: Not all of the image styles obey the color, rotateDegrees
 and inset parameters.  It's a todo.
