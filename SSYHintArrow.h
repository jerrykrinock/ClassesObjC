/*!
 @brief    Produces a fat Help Arrow with a blue gradient and
 white border, with some animation, similar to the one you
 get in a Cocoa app when you click Help, search for a menu item
 and select the result.

 @details  The fat blue arrow is an attached window.
 
 It is instantiated as a singleton.  (Certainly one would not want more
 than one of these buggers displayed at once!)
 
 Apple's fat blue menu-item pointer makes a little circle continuously.
 I think that's kind of confusing, and since Marcus Zarra's animation
 code (acknowledged below) shakes the arrow back and forth, I gave it
 parameters to point at the target point three times and then stop.
 I like this much better than the little circles.
 
 There are four ways to remove the SSYHintArrow's arrow from the
 screen.  The most common way is that the user clicks somewhere in the
 host window, and you send +removeIfEvent: from within your override of
 the host window's -sendEvent method.  The second way is if the user
 decides to click on the SSYHintArrow itself, it is programmed in this
 same way.  The third way is to send +remove.  The final way is to use
 the built-in fail safe, which is that if for some reason the window is
 closed while SSYHintArrow is attached to it, SSYHintArrow will
 detect the closure and remove itself.
 
 In all four cases, SSYHintArrow cleans up after itself; you
 don't need to release or close anything.
 
 REQUIREMENTS
 
 You'll need to link /System/Library/Frameworks/QuartzCore.framework
 into any project including this class.
 
 Requires SDK Mac OS 10.5 or later.

 There is no Cocoa method to get exactly that.  To get this
 behavior, you must override -sendEvent: in a subclass of the
 host window, and within it send this message, like this
 
 #import "SSYHintArrow.h"
 
 @implementation MyWindow
 
 - (void)sendEvent:(NSEvent *)event {
     // your other code here, if any
     [SSYHintArrow removeIfEvent:event] ;

     [super sendEvent:event] ;
