 @brief    Uses a Mach port as a semaphore.  Useful
 in running exclusive processes.
 
 @details  This is much easier and better than using
 the methods in semaphore.h.  See http://lists.apple.com/archives/darwin-kernel/2009/Mar/msg00067.html

 When using Mach ports like this, you have to be very careful about
 bootstrap namespaces.  Each process inherits a reference to a
 bootstrap namespace, meaning that which namespace it registers in
 depends on how it was launched. A port registration will only fail
 if the conflicting process is in the same namespace.  This may or
 may not be what you want. 
 
 TN2083 has all the gory details.
 
 Jerry: Thanks, Quinn.  I believe I'm OK since my mutually-exclusive
 processes are all current-user agents launched by launchd to
 fulfill tasks in ~/Library/LaunchAgents.  So, I am obeying the
 "rules to remember" in TN2083, and they should all be in the
 same namespace.
