/*!
 @brief    A more powerful replacement for some NSFileManager functions,
 which can present an authentication dialog and perform some actions with
 elevated permissions if necessary.

 @details  This class requires CPHTaskMaster, which in turn requires
 Mac OS X 10.6, to do anything useful.  If the deployment target
 (MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED) is Mac OS X 10.5 or less,
 methods in this class will return an error if called upon to do
 anything that NSFileManager can't do.  The idea is that you
 can still use it in targets compiled with low deployment
 targets

 @brief    Sets given permissions of a filesystem item at a given path,

 @param    permission  The value of the BSD permissions to be set,
 typically a number such as octal 40777.  Remember that the compiler
 interprets a literal integer with a leading zero to be an octal number; 
 i.e. 040777 = 0x41FF = decimal 16895.
 @param    path  The path for which permissions should be changed
 @param    changedPermissions  If permissions were successfully changed,
 the given path will be added as a key to this dictionary, with a value
 equal to an NSNumber whose unsigned short value is the original permissions
 of the parent directory before they were changed.
 @param    error_p  Pointer to an NSError which, if permissions could not be
 changed , will point to an NSError instance explaining why
 permissions could not be changed.  Otherwise, this pointer will be
 untouched.
 @result   YES if the permissions were successfully changed.

 asks user for authentication and momentarily sets permissions to
 040777.  Restores all permissions to old values before
 returning.

 points to a directory, otherwise contains NO.&nbsp;   If path
 doesnâ€™t exist, the return value is undefined.&nbsp;  Pass NULL
 if you do not need this information.

 point to a BOOL indicating whether or not it was necessary to
 ask the user for elevated permissions to perform the operation.
 Pass NULL if you do not need this information.

 occured and said pointer is not NULL, point to an NSError
