/*!
 @brief    Enumeration of the different types of changes which can be applied
 to a model object.
 
 @details  Similar to NSKeyValueChangeKindKey enumeration, except
 we added things that Apple left out which are needed for
 describing undoable actions, etc.
 
 The order of the elements is such that the most important changes
 have lower values (higher priority).  This is important to set
 the correct change type in -[Stange tryNewChangeType:].

	/* Note 098534.  The 'was1' values were used before BookMacster version 1.5.7.  The change
	 was apparently made to fix a bug which caused changes in item attributes,
	 for example a bookmarkâ€™s name, to be not counted if the item had also been moved
	 or slid within its family by an Import or Export operation.  This could cause
	 under-counting of changes, allowing an Import or Export operation which had over
	 the Safe Limit number of changes to be not detected as such.  In other words,
	 Change Counts wants to see Modify by a higher priority than Move and Slide.
	 However, I discovered while developing BookMacster 1.7/1.6.8 that this change
	 caused a regression in exporting to Google Chrome with Style 2 because that
	 JavaScript needs to do moves and slides first; otherwise items may be attempted
	 to be placed with gaps in families, which will cause errors in the JavaScript
	 background.html function doNextPut().  To solve this problem I introduced the
