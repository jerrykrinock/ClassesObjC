 @brief    Returns a new UUID string represented as 22 base64url characters,
 
 @details  Note that base64url, defined in RFC 4648, differs from conventional
 Base64 in that uses '-' and '_' instead of '/' and '+' as the 63rd and 64th
 characters.  This is because these are more "URL friendly"â€¦

 This character set has also been adopted by Mozilla for bookmark GUID in
 Firefox:

 characters.
