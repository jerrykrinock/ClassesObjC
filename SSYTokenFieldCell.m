 @brief    Calculates the expansion frame which is used to display the

 @details  This is a workaround for the fact that -[NSTableColumn dataCell],
 even though it claims to be an NSTextFieldCell, must have some magic built
 into it which allows the expansion frame tool tip to be calculated
 correctly regardless of -wraps, -isScrollable, and -truncatesLastVisibleLine.
 The [[NSTextFieldCell alloc] init] used to draw the text in this class
 does not have that magic, so we calculate it from scratch, based on the
 current attributed string value.
