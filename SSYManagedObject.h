 @brief    Some stuff Apple left out.

 @details  It looks like this could be a category instead of a subclass.

 We recommend an import use its own MOC, and simply set the undo
 manager on the MOC to nil.  Easier, better, less filling.
 
 The staleness interval has nothing to do with imports.  It affects
 the, well, staleness of cached data for faulting.
 
 It's insufficient to drain the autorelease pool every 1000
 iterations.  You need to actually save the MOC, then drain the pool.
 Until you save, the MOC needs to retain all the pending changes you've
 made to the inserted objects.  Losing changes just because somebody
 popped an autorelease pool would be bad.  This is documented in
 several places, including the programming guide and -
 setRetainsRegisteredObject:
 
 There is an additional issue that complicates matters greatly under
 the retain/release (not GC) memory model.  Managed objects with
 relationships nearly always create unreclaimable retain cycles.
 
 Example:
 
 Department <->> People
 
 Department has a relationship to many people, and each person has an
 inverse relationship to the department.  Since these objects retain
 each other, the retain game is over.  This is a fundamental limitation
 to retain counting.
 
 To help alleviate this, Core Data allows you to turn a managed object
 back into a fault.  You can turn a specific object back into a fault
 with -refreshObject:mergeChanges:NO (which shouldn't be called on a
 managed object with unsaved changes pending).  Or you can use the
 sledge hammer, and just -reset the whole context.  A big but not quite
 that big hammer would be to call -registeredObjects on the MOC you
 just saved, and then for (NSManagedObject* mo in registeredObjects)
 { [moc refreshObject:mo mergeChanges:NO] }  This is a bit like reset,
 but you can still re-use the managed objects themselves in the future.
 
 As for why can't Core Data break the retain cycles for the objects you
 no longer want (i.e. like -reset, but not everything), how would we
 know ?  We can't tell the difference between your UI/array controller/
 whatever retaining an object, and an inverse relationship retaining
 the object.  It's trivial enough for you to grab the -
 registeredObjects set, make a mutable copy, remove the objects you
 want to preserve, and refresh the rest.  And if you can't tell the
 difference between the objects you want to preserve and those you want
 to nuke, how could we ?
 
 If you have concrete ideas for an API that would make this easier,
 please file an enhancement request at bugreport.apple.com
 
 The only meaningful difference between -reset and -release on the MOC
 is whether or not you ever need to use that MOC object again.  And,
 now under GC, -reset is more immediate.
 
 It may occur to some to ask why turning the object back into a fault
 helps.  Faults represent futures for unrealized/unmaterialized pieces
 of a graph of connected objects.  They don't retain anything as they
 have no data, just an identity.  A managed object that's in use has
 data, and retains that data much in the same way any Cocoa object's
 standard setter methods might work.  The active pieces of the graph
 are wired down, and the periphery are faults.  Like a cloud.  If you
 turn enough of the center pieces of the cloud back into faults, you'll
 have multiple distinct clouds instead (which is usually better)
 
 MOC are not particularly expensive to create, so if you cache your
 PSC, you can use different MOCs for different working sets or distinct
 operations.
 
 I can import millions of records in a stable 3MB of memory without
 calling -reset.

 @brief    Same as -owner, except returns the owner with a retain count of 1

 @details  This method is recommended instead of -owner whenever the owner is
 a transient object which may not be deallocced for a long time due to the
 unpredictable release of the autoreleased owner.  This may be exacerbated by
 the anal-retentive nature of Core Data, some of which is explained in here.

 https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CoreData/MO_Lifecycle.html

 Note that the problem being solved here is an artifact of autorelease pools.
 The problem would be moot if we were using Automatic Reference Counting (ARC).

 The reason for the prefix 'alloc' is that, of the four prefixes which
 tell the clang objective-c static analyzer that this method returns an object
 which the caller "owns", as explained here

https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/MemoryMgmt/Articles/mmRules.html

 'alloc' is the least nonsensical for this case.

/*!
 @brief    Posts a SSYManagedObjectWillUpdateNotification notification.

 @details  This is a workaround for Apple Bug 6624874, using Solution 2.
 
 Solution 2.  Use Custom Setters.  For each key/value in each object that
 is to be observed, implement a custom setter, and in each such custom setter
 post a (regular, as in NSNotificationCenter) notification of the value change.
 This is not too bad with attributes, because there is only one setter per
 attribute.  But for to-many relations you need to override the four
 (or is it five) set mutator methods in order to cover all the possible
 ways in which the relationship may be changed.&nbsp; 
 What if more mutator methods are added in some future version of Mac OS?
 This requires much code and seems quite fragile.
 
 In your custom setter, you should invoke this method <i>before</i>
 actually changing the value (with willChangeValueForKey:, setPrimitiveXXXX:,
 didChangeValueForKey:).&nbsp;  This is so that the observer method
 receiving the notification can still send [object key] and get the
 <i>old</i> value, for comparison with the new value that you pass as a
 parameter here.
 
 See header file for custom accessor templates.
