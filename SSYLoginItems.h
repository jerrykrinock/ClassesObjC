/*!
 @brief    A Cocoa wrapper around LSSharedFileList for adding or removing Login Items.

 @details  SSYLoginItems.h/.c is an Obj-C wrapper on LSSharedFileList which provides some class methods to query, add and remove items from the user's "Login Items" in System Preferences.
 
 SSLoginItems.h/.c may be used in other projects.  Mac OS 10.5 and the CoreServices framework are required.
 
 QUICK START
 
 Run the demo project and follow the instructions in the console.  It will examine, add and remove items from your Login Items.  It will ask you to verify the results by examining your Login Items and then pressing return six times.
 
 BUGS
 
 When I run the program, I find two repeatable bugs:
 • In Test 1, Login Items that have the "Hidden" box checked are reported to have hidden=0.
 • In test 5, when the tool sets a Login Item with hidden=1, the "Hidden" box in Login Items does not get checked.
 
 I believe this is due to a bug in the LSSharedFileList API which I have entered into Apple Bug Reporter.  Problem ID 5901742
 
 30-Apr-2008 01:48 PM Jerry Krinock: 
 
 * SUMMARY The 'hidden' attribute for Login Items in the LSSharedList API has a disconnect with the reality. In more detail, when reading a Login Item, the 'hidden' attribute is read as 0, even if it is in fact '1', unless the 'hidden' attribute has been set by the LSSharedList API. In that case, it doesn't really set, but when you read it back with the API, it says that it is set, even though in fact it is not.
 
 * STEPS TO REPRODUCE Build and run the attached project. Follow the prompts shown in the the console.
 
 * EXPECTED RESULTS In all tests, the values read and written using the LSSharedList API and shown in the log should agree with what is shown in the System Preferences application.
 
 * ACTUAL RESULTS In Test #1, items which have the "Hide" box checked in System Preferences read from the API hidden=0. In Test #5, although the API set Safari to "Hide" and the API read it back as hidden=1, if you look in System Preferences you see that the "Hide" box is not checked. 
 
 REVISIONS:
 
 20090818: Bogus items in Login Items (which, I believe, are items for which the path has disappeared) are now ignored instead of causing an error to be returned and, later, a crash.
 20090819: I believe I fixed conceptual memory-management errors.  In some places, I was releasing the elements in the 'snapshot' array, in addition to releasing the array itself (which is correct), and compensating by retaining (but not always).  I'm still not sure that it's all correct, but it's better than it was.
 20090925: Removed dependency on NSError+SSYAdds.h/.m, added dependency on smaller NSError+LowLevel.h/.m
 20091125: Added Localized Failure Reason and Localized Recovery Suggestion to error with code 19584 which occurs if the user has a bogus Login Item.
 20100407: Made Localized Recovery Suggestion for error 19584 less confusing, and defined constants for all error codes.  Error 19584 is now SSYLoginItemsCouldNotResolveExistingItemErrorCode.
