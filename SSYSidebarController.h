 @brief    SSYSidebarController toggles a *sidebar view* in a window between
 completely collapsed and comletely expanded states, simultaneously adjusting,
 as appropriate, the size and/or position of a sibling adjacent *main* view
 and the window in which both views reside

 @details

 ## Auto Layout
 
 SSYSidebarController does not use Auto Layout.  I have not thought much about
 whether or not you could, for instance, use Auto Layout in the main and
 sidebar views.  The use case I had for writing SSYSidebarController were
 to replace NSDrawer instances in a old pre Auto-Layout project.
 
 ## View Size Variability
 
 Each time the sidebar is expanded, you may specify a minimum length (height
 or width, depending on `whichEdge`) for the main view.  If this is less than
 its current length, SSYSidebarView will partially collapse the main view, down
 to that minimum, before expanding the window.
 
 The sidebar length (height or width, depending on `whichEdge`) is fixed during
 -awakeFromNib.  Attempting to change it may cause unexpected results.  Its
 other dimention (width or height) may be changed.
 
 ## Window Edges

 The "sidebar" view can appear on any of the four window edges; in
 other words it can also be a *topbar* or *bottombar*.  But we call it a
 *sidebar* in all cases.  Think *side information* or *side controls*.  You may
 theoretically put sidebars on all four edges of a window, although I've only
 tested one and two.

 ## Usage

 Note that, unlike NSSplitViewController, SSYSidebarController does not inherit
 from NSViewController.  It actually controls not one view but two â€“ the *main*
 and the *sidebar* views.  Typically, you instantiate one SSYSidebarController
 in a xib or storyboard that contains the window, main view and sidebar view,
 and the latter two should be connected to SSYSidebarController's outlets.
 It is recommended to place the main view and sidebar view as siblings in a
 window's content view, abutting one another and filling the content view in
 the same way as they would when the sidebar is expanded.  Nonetheless, your
 window will initially appear with the sidebar collapsed, because
 SSYSidebarController collapses it during its -awakeFromNib.

 You may also instantiate SSYSidebarController in code.

 ## Relation to NSDrawer and NSSplitView

 Since 2012 or so, NSDrawer has been dis-recommended by Apple.  When
 a window with a NSDrawer loads, a bunch of crap is logged to the Xcode
 console, and also, sometimes, drawer content does not load.  One solution is
 to replace NSDrawer with NSSplitView and NSSplitViewController, but those
 two are quite complicated to use, buggy.  If you have obvious buttons in
 your user interface for opening and closing the drawer, maybe you don't need
 the draggable devider bar.  In that case, you can simply put your drawer
 contents in a sibling subview to the window's main view and instantiate a
 SSYSidebarController in your window controller.

 ## Troubleshooting

 If your views are not sizing as expected, think about their autoresize masks
 ("springs and struts" in Interface Builder), and those of their subviews.
